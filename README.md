# About the Project
The project is a simple GUI application that uses the Tkinter module in order to create a design view. The system can be accessed without the use of login information. The user can add a new contact by providing personal details such as first name, last name, gender, address, and contact number. The system table can also be updating the contact list if he/she double click the row of that particular data. The system was made simpler so that beginners can learn and enhance their programming skills in developing the python language.

# Features:
* The user can view the list of all contact as soon as the application has launched.
* You can freely add more contacts by supplying the needed details.
* The system has a function that can update the list of contact by double-clicking the targeted row and change the data in the input field.
* The system also allowed to delete some contact by clicking the targeted row and click the delete button
